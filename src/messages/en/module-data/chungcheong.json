  "note": "Chungcheong is the heart of Korea's Baekje UNESCO World Heritage sites. Just 50 minutes from Seoul by KTX, it is highly accessible and connects well with Gyeongsang and Jeolla provinces. In summer (July~August), the Boryeong Mud Festival and lotus flowers at Gungnamji Pond are added highlights. Autumn (October~November) brings peak foliage at Gyeryongsan, while Yuseong Hot Springs are popular in winter. As most Gongju and Buyeo heritage sites are outdoors, adjust your itinerary to focus on the national museums on rainy days."
