  "note": "Gangwon's highlights are Gyeongpodae and Jumunjin beaches in summer (July–August) and Yongpyong/Alpensia skiing in winter (December–March). Prices rise sharply during peak season, so spring (cherry blossoms) and autumn (foliage) are recommended. If adding a winter ski day, allow one full day (lift + rental + lessons total ₩150,000–200,000). A pre-dawn visit is required to catch the sunrise at Naksansa. Adding Chuncheon (dak-galbi + Nami Island) requires an extra 1.5 hours from Gangneung."
